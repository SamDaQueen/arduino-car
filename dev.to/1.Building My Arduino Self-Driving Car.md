# 🔥Wheels and Wires: Building My Arduino Self-Driving Car🚗👩‍💻

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Wheels & Wires" series, where I'll document my journey of building an Arduino-based self-driving car. Join me as I dive into embedded programming and real-time systems, learning as I build, troubleshoot, and discover. I will also try to make this series like a guide, providing detailed insights, code, and solutions to the challenges encountered along the way.

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to construct a self-driving car using an Arduino, actuators, sensors, and a path-finding algorithm. There will be a camera to track the position of the car relative to a goal and detect obstacles in its path. Using data from the camera and onboard sensors, the Arduino will receive wireless instructions to control its movement.

### What to Expect

In each post, I'll provide insights into the challenges I face, the solutions I come up with, and the progress I make. From coding hurdles to hardware integrations, I'll cover it all.

### What's Next

Stay tuned for the next installment, where we'll dive into the details of setting up the project environment and getting started with the hardware.
